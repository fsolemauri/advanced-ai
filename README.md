# Advanced Artificial Intelligence
URV Master's Course 2024-2025

## Description
This repository contains coursework and materials for the Advanced Artificial Intelligence course in the Mathematical Engineering Master's program at URV. The course covers key AI topics including recommender systems, feature extraction, classification, optimization, and deep learning.

## Course Structure
The repository is organized into five main modules:

1. Recommender Systems
   - Theory and implementation
   - Collaborative and content-based filtering
   - Performance evaluation

2. Feature Extraction and Selection
   - Dimensionality reduction
   - Feature selection methods
   - Principal Component Analysis

3. Classification
   - Advanced classification algorithms
   - Model evaluation
   - Performance metrics

4. Optimization
   - Optimization techniques
   - Gradient descent variants
   - Hyperparameter tuning

5. Deep Learning
   - Neural network architectures
   - Training methodologies
   - Applications

Each module contains:
- `theory_files/`: Lecture materials and notes
- `CATs/`: Continuous Assessment Tests
- `resources/`: Additional materials and references
